                                   <p> My name is Joseph I’m a film major at the University of Rhode Island in my senior year. <br>
                                     I was a bio major for a while, but I got bored and tired of it so I switched to my current major. <br>
                                     Computer science might come in handy if I ever want to program anything for film or build an online portfolio for my self. <br>
                                     After I graduate I plan to move out to la of New York for my film career as that’s where all the work is for the industry. <br>
                                     quarantine has been going for a while I worked an online internship at the interfaith center of Philadelphia over the summer that went well. <br>  
                                         </p>
